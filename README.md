# Expression_Detector
A CNN based model to detect expressions given through webcam.
Used haar_cascade to detect faces through webcam.
My model consists of: 
--> 4 Convolutional layers
--> 3 Dense Layers
--> I used Data augmentation,Dropout Layers and Max_pooling too

I used training,testing  data from www.kaggle.com  which consistes of pixels of images in the form of csv file.
